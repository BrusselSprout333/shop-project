# shop-project

<p>This project presents a web application of an online store. It is possible here to manage the database on behalf of the administrator, specifically adding, deleting and editing products. From the user's side, it is possible to view the available products and add them to the basket for a subsequent order. </p>

<p>Here I used HTML+CSS, PHP and MySql</p>
